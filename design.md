## Design Environment

Just as the component-based approach on the hardware side is beneficial, we have developed our design environment utilizing [TinyOS](http://tinyos.net/) which is a component based operating system for wireless sensor networks and embedded devices.

We are using a graphical design environment to welcome all sorts of users. The graphical modeling environment is being developed on top of [WebGME](http://webgme.org).

All the source code along with the instructions is served at the Github page: [Design Environment Source Code](https://github.com/pillforge/mcr_ide).
