abstract = {The first wireless camera pills created a revolutionary new perspective for engineers and physicians, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of achieving medical objectives deep within the human body from a swallowable, wireless platform. The approximately 10 years since the first camera pill has been a period of great innovation in swallowable medical devices. Many modules and integrated systems have been devised to enable and enhance the diagnostic and even robotic capabilities of capsules working within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This article begins by reviewing the motivation and challenges of creating devices to work in the narrow, winding, and often inhospitable GI environment. Then the basic modules of modern swallowable wireless capsular devices are described, and the state of the art in each is discussed. This article is concluded with a perspective on the future potential of swallowable medical devices to enable advanced diagnostics beyond the capability of human visual perception, and even to directly deliver surgical tools and therapy non-invasively to interventional sites deep within the GI tract. {\textcopyright} 2010 Authors.},

abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is home to some of the most deadly human diseases. Exacerbating the problem is the difficulty of accessing it for diagnosis or intervention and the concomitant patient discomfort. Flexible endoscopy has established itself as the method of choice and its diagnostic accuracy is high, but there remain technical limitations in modern scopes, and the procedure is poorly tolerated by patients, leading to low rates of compliance with screening guidelines. Although advancement in clinical endoscope design has been slow in recent years, a critical mass of enabling technologies is now paving the way for the next generation of gastrointestinal endoscopes. This review describes current endoscopes and provides an overview of innovative flexible scopes and wireless capsules that can enable painless endoscopy and/or enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. We provide a perspective on the potential of these new technologies to address the limitations of current endoscopes in mass cancer screening and other contexts and thus to save many lives.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women worldwide. Diagnosing colorectal has been increasingly successful due to advances in technology. Flexible endoscopy is considered to be an effective method for early diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal cancer, making it a popular choice for screening programs. However, millions of people who may benefit from endoscopic colorectal cancer screening fail to have the procedure performed. Main reasons include psychological barriers due to the indignity of the procedure, fear of procedure related pain, bowel preparation discomfort, and potential need for sedation. Therefore, an urgent need for new technologies addressing these issues clearly exists. In this review, we discuss a set of advanced endoscopic technologies for colorectal cancer screening that are either already available or close to clinical trial. In particular, we focus on visual-inspection-only advanced flexible colonoscopes, interventional colonoscopes with alternative propulsion mechanisms, wireless capsule colonoscopy, and technologies for intraprocedural bowel cleansing. Many of these devices have the potential to reduce exam related patient discomfort, obviate the need for sedation, increase diagnostic yield, reduce learning curves, improve access to screening, and possibly avert the need for a bowel preparation.},

abstract = {Magnetic coupling is one of the few physical phenomena capable of transmitting motion across a physical barrier. In gastrointestinal endoscopy, remote magnetic manipulation has the potential to make screening less invasive and more acceptable, thus saving lives by early diagnoses and treatment. Closed-loop control of the magnetic device position is crucial for a safe and reliable operation. In order to implement closed-loop control, the pose (position and orientation) of the device must be available in real-time. This becomes challenging if magnetic coupling is achieved by permanentmagnets, since the strong magnetic field required for manipulation interferes with current localization techniques. In this work, we present a novel real-time pose detection strategy that is compatible with magnetic manipulation based on permanent magnets. The localization algorithm combines multiple sensor readings with a pre-calculated magnetic field map. The proposed approach is able to provide an average error below 5 mm in position detection, and below 19 for angular motion within a spherical workspace of 15 cm in radius.},

Less invasive procedures can be achieved with the use of wireless Medical Capsule Robots (MCRs). MCRs are low powered and small in size and can be used for physiological parameter monitoring, therapy delivery, and biopsy sampling. Designing MCRs from the ground up is a costly and time consuming process. In this work, we present a flexible modular architecture to facilitate the design of MCRs and propose using TinyOS as the operating system. To assess the architecture and validate the feasibility of TinyOS, we implement a closed-loop control of a sensor-actuator system and compare the results with a traditional MCR built based on an 8051 microcontroller (MCU) programmed in plain C. Similar performances from the two approaches lead us to conclude that TinyOS is a valid option to implement a modular architecture for designing MCRs.},

abstract = {Active locomotion of wireless capsule endoscopes has the potential to improve the diagnostic yield of this painless technique for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract disease. In order to design effective locomotion mechanisms, a quantitative measure of the propelling force required to effectively move a capsule inside the gastrointestinal tract is necessary. In this study, we introduce a novel wireless platform that is able to measure the force opposing capsule motion, without perturbing the physiologic conditions with physical connections to the outside of the gastrointestinal tract. The platform takes advantage of a wireless capsule that is magnetically coupled with an external permanent magnet. A secondary contribution of this manuscript is to present a real-time method to estimate the axial magnetic force acting on a wireless capsule manipulated by an external magnetic field. In addition to the intermagnetic force, the platform provides real-time measurements of the capsule position, velocity, and acceleration. The platform was assessed with benchtop trials within a workspace that extends 15 cm from each side of the external permanent magnet, showing average error in estimating the force and the position of less than 0.1 N and 10 mm, respectively. The platform was also able to estimate the dynamic behavior of a known resistant force with an error of 5.45{\%}. Finally, an in vivo experiment on a porcine colon model validated the feasibility of measuring the resistant force in opposition to magnetic propulsion of a wireless capsule.},

abstract = {Background and study aims: Capsule endoscopy is an attractive alternative to colorectal cancer screening by conventional colonoscopy, but is currently limited by compromised mucosal visibility because of the lack of safe, controlled colonic insufflation. We have therefore developed a novel system of untethered, wireless-controlled carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation for use in colonic capsule endoscopy, which this study aims to assess in vivo. Material and methods: This observational, nonsurvival, in vivo study used five Yorkshire-Landrace cross swine. A novel insufflation capsule was placed in the porcine colons, and we recorded volume of insufflation, time, force, visualization, and a pathologic assessment of the colon. Results: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) diameter of insufflation was 32.1 (3.9) mm. The volume of CO2 produced successfully allowed complete endoscopic visualization of the mucosa and safe proximal passage of the endoscope. Pathologic examination demonstrated no evidence of trauma caused by the capsule. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the feasibility of a novel method of controlled colonic insufflation via an untethered capsule in vivo. This technological innovation addresses a critical need in colon capsule endoscopy.},

abstract = {In an open surgery, identification of precise margins for curative tissue resection is performed by manual palpation. This is not the case for minimally invasive and robotic procedures, where tactile feedback is either distorted or not available. In this paper, we introduce the concept of intraoperative wireless tissue palpation. The wireless palpation probe (WPP) is a cylindrical device (15 mm in diameter, 60 mm in length) that can be deployed through a trocar incision and directly controlled by the surgeon to create a volumetric stiffness distribution map of the region of interest. This map can then be used to guide the tissue resection to minimize healthy tissue loss. The wireless operation prevents the need for a dedicated port and reduces the chance of instrument clashing in the operating field. The WPP is able to measure in real time the indentation pressure with a sensitivity of 34 Pa, the indentation depth with an accuracy of 0.68 mm, and the probe position with a maximum error of 11.3 mm in a tridimensional workspace. The WPP was assessed on the benchtop in detecting the local stiffness of two different silicone tissue simulators (elastic modulus ranging from 45 to 220 kPa), showing a maximum relative error below 5{\%}. Then, in vivo trials were aimed to identify an agar-gel lump injected into a porcine liver and to assess the device usability within the frame of a laparoscopic procedure. The stiffness map created intraoperatively by the WPP was compared with a map generated ex vivo by a standard uniaxial material tester, showing less than 8{\%} local stiffness error at the site of the lump.},

abstract = {We propose local magnetic actuation (LMA) as an approach to robotic actuation for surgical instruments. An LMA actuation unit consists of a pair of diametrically magnetized single-dipole cylindrical magnets, working as magnetic gears across the abdominal wall. In this study, we developed a dynamic model for an LMA actuation unit by extending the theory proposed for coaxial magnetic gears. The dynamic model was used for closed-loop control, and two alternative strategies - using either the angular velocity at the motor or at the load as feedback parameter - were compared. The amount of mechanical power that can be transferred across the abdominal wall at different intermagnetic distances was also investigated. The proposed dynamic model presented a relative error below 7.5{\%} in estimating the load torque from the system parameters. Both the strategies proposed for closed-loop control were effective in regulating the load speed with a relative error below 2{\%} of the desired steady-state value. However, the load-side closed-loop control approach was more precise and allowed the system to transmit larger values of torque, showing, at the same time, less dependence from the angular velocity. In particular, an average value of 1.5 mNm can be transferred at 7 cm, increasing up to 13.5 mNm as the separation distance is reduced down to 2 cm. Given the constraints in diameter and volume for a surgical instrument, the proposed approach allows for transferring a larger amount of mechanical power than what would be possible to achieve by embedding commercial dc motors.  2004-2012 IEEE.},

Although the research in the area of MCRs is an active topic and has grown exponentially, current devices provide only limited functionalities because their design process is expensive and time consuming. To open this research field to a wider community and, at the same time, create better designs through advanced tool support, in our previous works we presented a design environment for the rapid development of MCRs. In this paper, this environment was adopted to design a Drug Delivery Capsule (DDC) based on a coil-magnet-piston mechanism. The force of the coil acting on the magnetic piston and the drug release profile were modeled and assessed on bench-top with a maximum relative error below 5{\%}. Then, in vivo trials were performed to validate the DDC functionality with a scheduled drug release profile for a 5. h and 24. min procedure. The resulting design environment template is available open source for further development of drug delivery applications as well as to serve as guideline in prototyping novel MCRs addressing other clinical needs.},

The primary focus of CE research in recent years has been enabling active CE manipulation and extension of the technology to therapeutic functionality, thus, widening the scope of the procedure. This review outlines clinical standards of the technology as well as recent advances in CE research. Clinical capsule applications are discussed with respect to each portion of the gastrointestinal tract.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to validate a Jacobian-based iterative method for real-time localization of magnetically controlled endoscopic capsules. The proposed approach applies finite-element solutions to the magnetic field problem and least-squares interpolations to obtain closed-form and fast estimates of the magnetic field. By defining a closed-form expression for the Jacobian of the magnetic field relative to changes in the capsule pose, we are able to obtain an iterative localization at a faster computational time when compared with prior works, without suffering from the inaccuracies stemming from dipole assumptions. This new algorithm can be used in conjunction with an absolute localization technique that provides initialization values at a slower refresh rate. The proposed approach was assessed via simulation and experimental trials, adopting a wireless capsule equipped with a permanent magnet, six magnetic field sensors, and an inertial measurement unit. The overall refresh rate, including sensor data acquisition and wireless communication was 7 ms, thus enabling closed-loop control strategies for magnetic manipulation running faster than 100 Hz. The average localization error, expressed in cylindrical coordinates was below 7 mm in both the radial and axial components and 5° in the azimuthal component. The average error for the capsule orientation angles, obtained by fusing gyroscope and inclinometer measurements, was below 5°.},
