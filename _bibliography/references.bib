abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is home to some of the most deadly human diseases. Exacerbating the problem is the difficulty of accessing it for diagnosis or intervention and the concomitant patient discomfort. Flexible endoscopy has established itself as the method of choice and its diagnostic accuracy is high, but there remain technical limitations in modern scopes, and the procedure is poorly tolerated by patients, leading to low rates of compliance with screening guidelines. Although advancement in clinical endoscope design has been slow in recent years, a critical mass of enabling technologies is now paving the way for the next generation of gastrointestinal endoscopes. This review describes current endoscopes and provides an overview of innovative flexible scopes and wireless capsules that can enable painless endoscopy and/or enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. We provide a perspective on the potential of these new technologies to address the limitations of current endoscopes in mass cancer screening and other contexts and thus to save many lives.},

abstract = {AbstractThe first wireless camera pills created a revolutionary new perspective for engineers and physicians, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of achieving medical objectives deep within the human body from a swallowable, wireless platform. The approximately 10 years since the first camera pill has been a period of great innovation in swallowable medical devices. Many modules and integrated systems have been devised to enable and enhance the diagnostic and even robotic capabilities of capsules working within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This article begins by reviewing the motivation and challenges of creating devices to work in the narrow, winding, and often inhospitable GI environment. Then the basic modules of modern swallowable wireless capsular devices are described, and the state of the art in each is discussed. This article is concluded with a perspective on the future potential of swallowable medical devices to enable advanced diagnostics beyond the capability of human visual perception, and even to directly deliver surgical tools and therapy non-invasively to interventional sites deep within the GI tract.},
